# X-HD

X-HD is a framework to exploit heat pump system design methods. In this repository, you find different approaches to do so.

If you want to investigate the design of heat pump systems HSM, OBM and SBM will help you:
Within a design approach comparison, we investigated three different design approaches: a heuristic-based method (HSM), an optimization-based method (OBM) and a simulation-based method (SBM). In this repository, we host the design approaches and share our code in order to accelerate the deployment of optimal designed heat pump systems for existing buildings. Idealised bivalent heat pump heating system based on two typical hydraulic structures. Models for components are taken from library AixLib: https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib

If you want to investigate vapor compression cycles in dynamic simulation models, have a look at our VCLib!
This library contains dynamic simulation models in Modelica from the refrigerant level to the system level.


A detailed description and publications will follow soon.
